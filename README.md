# MCQ-Generator-using-nlp
 This "Question MCQs Generator" is a Python-based project that uses spacy's NLP capabilities to automatically generate multiple-choice questions from a given text. It processes the text to extract sentences, selects a subset randomly, and forms coherent and contextually relevant questions, making it an ideal tool for educators and content creators.
